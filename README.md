# Womxn in XR

Womxn in XR is a [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org)-powered Twitter directory of accomplished women and non-binary individuals in the XR industry. It aims to help people find notable and relevant voices to follow on Twitter by parsing Twitter bios for popular keywords.

Here are some things Womxn in XR can help you with:

- **If you're a Twitter user, use this project to diversify the voices in your feed.** Run [proporti.onl](https://www.proporti.onl/) to check the ratio of the people you follow on Twitter. If you're following more men than women, follow women who work in your areas of interest. Be aware that a feed of white women is not diverse.
- **If you're a hiring manager, use this project to find candidates.** Examine the ratio of senior men to senior women in your organization. Are women of color equally represented? Consider hiring women into promotions above their current role.
- **If you're organizing a conference, use this project to find speakers.** Ensure that the women's speaking slots are as prominent as the men's. Are women of color equally represented? Consider reaching out to women who have never given a talk before.
- **If you have a podcast, use this project to find new guests.** Be mindful of interruptions and ensure that your women guests get equal speaking time. Are women of color equally represented? Consider inviting women who don't already have an audience.
